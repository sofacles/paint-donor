        Check your email for a confirmation link and click on the link inside. After you confirm, we'll start show your
        paint on our site. If somebody is interested in receiving your paint, our system will relay an email from them
        to you. We will continue to show your paint until you click the cancel link in the confirmation email, but we
        will delete it after a year to save space.
